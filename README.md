This folder contains the codes for determining the number of factors by double cross validation, panel criterion and ladel.

'DCVk' contains the matlab code for K-fold double cross validation.

'PC' contains the matlab code for penal criterion, which is introduced in "Bai, J., and Ng, S. (2002). Determining the number of factors in approximate factor models. Econometrica, 70(1), 191-221."

'ratio' contains the matlab code for the ratio-based estimator, which is introduced in "Lam, C. and Yao, Q. (2012). Factor modeling for high-dimensional time series: inference for the number of factors. The Annals of Statistics, 40(2):694-726."

'ladle' contains the matlab code for the ladle estimator, which is introduced in "Luo, W., and Li, B. (2016). Combining eigenvalues and variation of eigenvectors for order determination. Biometrika, 103(4), 875-887."
